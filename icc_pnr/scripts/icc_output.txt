   Data Types

ARGUMENTS
       -stage global | track | detail
              Specifies the routing stages to  run  before  running  topology-
              based optimization.

              If you do not specify this option, the tool runs global routing,
              track assignment, and detail routing  before  running  optimiza-
              tion.

              If  you specify -stage global, the tool runs only global routing
              before running optimization.

              If you specify -stage track, the tool runs  global  routing  and
              track assignment before running optimization.

              IF  you specify -stage detail, the tool runs only detail routing
              before running optimization. The  design  must  already  contain
              global route and track assignment information.

              If  you  specify -stage global or -stage track when block inter-
              face optimization is enabled, the tool issues a warning  message
              and ignores block interface optimization. To use block interface
              optimization,  either  remove  this  option  or  specify  -stage
              detail.

       -xtalk_reduction
              Runs  routing-based  crosstalk  reduction  signal integrity (SI)
              optimization.

              This option is applicable only if you  enable  signal  integrity
              mode  before  running  the  route_opt command. You enable signal
              integrity mode by setting the -route_xtalk_prevention option  of
              the  set_si_options  command to true. By default, this option is
              set to false. If you specify the -xtalk_reduction option without
              enabling signal integrity mode, the tool issues an error message
              and stops. If you specify this  option  and  also  enable  block
              interface optimization, the tool honors the option only for top-
              level nets.

       -only_xtalk_reduction
              Runs only routing-based crosstalk reduction.

              Similar to the -xtalk_reduction option, this option is  applica-
              ble  only  if  you  enable  signal  integrity  mode  running the
              route_opt command. If you specify this option  without  enabling
              signal  integrity  mode or if you specify any other options with
              the -only_xtalk_reduction option, the tool issues an error  mes-
              sage and stops. If you specify this option and also enable block
              interface optimization, the tool will honor the option only  for
              top-level nets.

       -power
              Enables topology-based leakage-power optimization.

              The  route_opt  command  can  perform leakage-power optimization
              based on either the multiple-threshold-voltage constraint or the
              leakage  values  of  the library cells. To perform leakage-power
              optimization based on the multiple-threshold-voltage constraint,
              use  the  set_multi_vth_constraint  command  to define this con-
              straint before running the  route_opt  command.   If  this  con-
              straint  is  not defined, the tool bases the leakage-power opti-
              mization on the leakage values of the library cells.

              When you specify this option for a multicorner-multimode design,
              you  must  use  the  set_scenario_options  command to select the
              leakage scenarios before running the route_opt command.

       -size_only
              Performs only sizing of cells  in  topology-based  optimization.
              You  can  use this option for designs that are very sensitive to
              postroute optimization changes.

              You control  the  sizing  method  by  setting  the  effort.   By
              default, the tool runs medium effort optimization, which enables
              in-place size-only optimization. To use footprint swapping,  set
              the  -effort option to low. To use regular density-based sizing,
              set the -effort option to high.

       -area_recovery
              Enables area recovery for cells that are not on timing  critical
              paths.

       -wire_size
              Enables  the use of an additional technique that sizes the width
              of route segments to fix setup time violations during  topology-
              based optimization.

              This  option  needs existing nondefault routing rules and it can
              change netlist.  The tool applies nondefault  routing  rules  to
              the  touched  nets  and the applied nondefault routing rules are
              not removed after wire sizing.

              If you specify this option and also enable block interface opti-
              mization, the tool honors the option only for top-level nets.

       -effort low | medium | high
              Specifies  the  effort  level for postroute optimizations in the
              route_opt flow. This option does not change  the  routing  steps
              performed by the route_opt command.

              Valid  values  are  low,  medium, and high.  In high effort, the
              tool is more aggressive during optimization and runs three opti-
              mization loops.

              The default effort level is medium.

       -initial_route_only
              Runs  only  the initial routing stage and does not perform opti-
              mization.

              This option cannot  be  used  with  the  -skip_initial_route  or
              -incremental options.

       -skip_initial_route
              Runs  the only topology-based optimization and ECO routing with-
              out running initial routing.

              Note that if signal integrity mode is enabled, this option  runs
              ECO  routing  without  signal  integrity followed by ECO routing
              with  signal  integrity.  This  differs  from  the  -incremental
              option,  which  runs only ECO routing with signal integrity when
              signal integrity mode is enabled.

              Using this option on a design that is not  detail  routed  might
              generate  erroneous  results;  therefore, you should verify that
              the design is fully routed before you use this option.

              This option cannot be used with the -initial_route_only, -incre-
              mental, or -stage options.

       -incremental
              Disables  running  of  the initial routing steps.  The tool runs
              only topology-based incremental optimization and ECO routing.

              Note that if signal integrity mode is enabled, this option  runs
              only  ECO routing with signal integrity and does not run the ECO
              routing  step  without  signal  integrity,  as  the   -skip_ini-
              tial_route option does.

              This   option  cannot  be  used  with  the  -initial_route_only,
              -skip_initial_route, or -stage options.

       -only_wire_size
              Performs only sizing of wires  during  topology-based  optimiza-
              tion.   The tool applies nondefault routing rules to the touched
              nets and the applied nondefault routing rules  are  not  removed
              after  wire  sizing.  If you specify this option and also enable
              block interface optimization, the tool honors  the  option  only
              for top-level nets.

       -only_hold_time
              Specifies that only hold time violations are fixed.

              This option is applicable only if you enabled hold fixing before
              running the route_opt command. You enable hold fixing  by  using
              the set_fix_hold command.

              This option can be used only with the -incremental option.

       -only_design_rule
              Specifies that only design rule fixing is performed.

              This option can be used only with the -incremental option.

       -only_power_recovery
              Specifies that only leakage power optimizations are performed.

              This option can be used only with the -incremental option.

       -only_area_recovery
              Specifies that only area optimizations are performed.

              This option can be used only with the -incremental option.

       -register_to_register
              Specifies  that  only  register-to-register optimization is per-
              formed.

              This option must be used with the -incremental option. The  only
              other  options  that  you  can  specify  with  this  option  are
              -size_only, -only_hold_time, or -only_design_rule.

       -concurrent_clock_and_data
              Optimizes the clock paths along with the data  paths.  The  data
              paths are optimized to fix setup and hold violations, as well as
              logical design rule violations.

              By default, the route_opt command optimizes only data paths.

              When you use this option, you must set  the  options  for  clock
              path      optimization      by     using     the     set_concur-
              rent_clock_and_data_strategy command.

       -only_concurrent_clock_and_data
              Optimizes the clock paths after performing  a  lightweight  data
              path optimization that fixes only setup violations.

              When  you  use  this  option, you must set the options for clock
              path     optimization     by     using      the      set_concur-
              rent_clock_and_data_strategy command.

       -optimize_wire_via
              Runs an extra wire length and via count optimization.

              This  option  is supported only by the classic router and cannot
              be used with Zroute.

              If you specify this option and also enable block interface opti-
              mization, the tool honors the option only for top-level nets.

       -num_cpus count
              Specifies  the  number of CPUs for detail routing and search and
              repair routing.  You can use up to 63 CPUs.

              By default, a single CPU is used.

              This option is applicable only if  you  are  using  the  classic
              router  and  you  set up multiple CPU mode by using the set_dis-
              tributed_route command prior to running the route_opt command.

              This option is supported only by the classic router  and  cannot
              be used with Zroute.

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  performs simultaneous routing and postroute optimization
       on the current design. The output of this command is a postroute  opti-
       mized  design. The route_opt flow runs differently depending on whether
       signal integrity mode is enabled.

       A  default  (medium  effort)  signal-integrity-enabled  route_opt  flow
       includes:

       1.  Initial routing: Global routing, track assignment, and detail rout-
         ing
         If you are using the classic router, it also runs search and  repair.

       2.  Topology-based  optimization  (adaptive) without considering signal
         integrity

       3. Topology-based signal integrity optimization

       A default  (medium  effort)  signal-integrity-disabled  route_opt  flow
       includes:

       1.  Initial routing: Global routing, track assignment, and detail rout-
         ing
         If you are using the classic router, it also runs search and  repair.

       2. Topology-based optimization without considering signal integrity

       You  can  add  routing-based crosstalk reduction to the default flow by
       using the -xtalk_reduction option. If you are using the classic router,
       you  can add wire length and via count optimization to the default flow
       by using the -optimize_wire_via  option.  The  signal-integrity-enabled
